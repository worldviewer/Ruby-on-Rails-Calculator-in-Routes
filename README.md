# Create a Calculator Using Routes in Rails

Using what we learned today about Rails and routes, create a calculator.

To get started, you'll want to use `rails new app_name` to create a new rails application. Don't forget to `cd` into the application directory after you create it with `rails new`.

Ok, if you're in the application directory, you should be ready to go, just type `subl .` to open the directory in Sublime Text.

## Steps to Complete the Calculator

First, you'll want to create an index page that uses the root 'route' that explains to a user what URLs to type in to be able to add/subtract/multiply/divide.

If you need help, you can refer to [today's notes](../../../lectures/week-06/_4_thursday/dusk/README.md), or to the [sample application we created in class](../../../lectures/week-06/_4_thursday/dusk/route_app).

Create 4 routes for each of the calculator functions (add, subtract, mult, divide).

Remember to name your URL parameters in your routes. We'd probably call those params `:x` and `:y`, but you can call them anything you want. After all, you're the developer and you're in control!
